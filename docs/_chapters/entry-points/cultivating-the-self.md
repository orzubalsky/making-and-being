---

We asked Alta Starr, lead facilitator at Generative Somatics, to write about embodiment for arts educators. The politicized, somatic methodology that Starr offers has helped to transform the way social movements in the United States operate. This methodology has also allowed us to access more of our own embodied knowledge as we teach. Starr will explain the generative somatics methodology, the importance of daily practice, and the process of somatic opening.

We invited cultural theorist Leigh Claire La Berge to write about the tensions held within the category of art itself. La Berge has shaped our understanding of the intersection of culture and political economy in informal and formal conversation, over the past five years. She will define key terms that reappear throughout the book, including: commodity, labor, capitalism, and aesthetics.

We invited Stacey Salazar, Director of the Master of Arts in Art Education at the Maryland Institute College of Art to provide an overview of the history of postsecondary and professional art education in the United States and to situate our work within this history. Salazarâ€™s writing about the lack of pedagogical training for art faculty at colleges and universities has helped us understand the need for pedagogical support and dialog between arts educators.

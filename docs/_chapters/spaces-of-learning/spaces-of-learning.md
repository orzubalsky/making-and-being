We begin by asking, what are your motivations when you enter a particular space of learning? For us, spaces of learning are both figurative and literal, referring to classrooms as well as learning groups, reading groups, collectives, and working groups (self-organized groups that have formed around a particular issue). Perhaps you want feedback or perhaps you wish to be pushed beyond your own limits of intellectual or artistic comfort. These are spaces where you might be exposed to differences in opinion, perspective, and background and where you might then try to make sense of yourself in relation to your shifting perspective of the world around you. In such spaces, you may choose to honor someone who has inspired you or you may desire to speak honestly about what feels urgent to you in your own life.

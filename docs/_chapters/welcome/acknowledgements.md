The book in your hands is the result of five years of work, five years of talking, writing, editing, drawing, and designing. We began working on _Making and Being_ in January of 2015. We have organized our acknowledgements using a lifecycle framework. The lifecycle framework relies upon an ecological metaphor to look at the entire “life” of a project, from the moment it is imagined to the moment it is discarded, recycled, or forgotten. We have identified ten components of each project’s lifecycle; we call these phases. A phase is a recognizable stage in the development of a project’s lifecycle.

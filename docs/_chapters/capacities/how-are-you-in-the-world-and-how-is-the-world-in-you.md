We will begin with a focus on the capacity called “coordination,” the ability to “effectively collaborate with others in teams, partnerships, alliances, and remain responsive to evolving conditions.” As we mentioned in the previous chapter, Zara Serabian-Arthur, a member-owner of the filmmaking cooperative Meerkat Media, has committed to the capacity of coordination. As Serabian-Arthur says: 

For us, an equally exciting project as making our work was the project of figuring out: Was it possible to create work in a way that reflected our values? What might that look like? Engaging in that work, honestly, has been the most fulfilling work that I’ve done as an artist, because it’s all about manifesting: What do these values, and these ideas of a different world look like in our daily practice? What does it feel like? How does that transform us as individuals, how does that transform us in a group, in a neighborhood, in a community, and what happens when we share those stories to transform the way things work more broadly?”

Worker cooperatives are values-driven businesses that put worker and community benefit at the core of their purpose, often run by workers. _See [Chapter 13: Labor]({% link _chapters/lifecycle-framework/labor.md %}) for more._

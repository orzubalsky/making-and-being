[_Making and Being_](https://squareup.com/store/makingandbeing) is a multi-platform pedagogical project that offers practices of contemplation, collaboration, and circulation in the visual arts. [_Making and Being_](https://squareup.com/store/makingandbeing) is a book, a series of videos, a deck of cards, and an interactive website with freely downloadable content created by authors Susan Jahoda and Caroline Woolard with support from [BFAMFAPhD](http://bfamfaphd.com) members Emilio Martinez Poppe, Agnes Szanyi, Emily Tareila, and Vicky Virgin.

We wrote this book for those of you who want a holistic art education that includes how to be both more fully present with yourself and with others. The term holistic means that the parts of any given system are intimately interconnected; that they are understandable only in relation to the whole system. How can you talk about making a new project without talking about labor conditions? How can you talk about labor conditions without talking about payment? Itâ€™s time to address your artistic labor, your budgets your storage units, your gifts, and your well-being.


The chapters in this book are organized in the way that we tend to describe our approach in workshops with teachers and students. We begin with an overview of the fields that connect to our book (Part 1: Entry Points), and then talk about why we believe it is urgent to rethink approaches to undergraduate, graduate, and self-organized art education (Chapter 1: Why Now). From there, we build a sense of support with a cohort of learners (Chapter 2: Spaces of Learning and Chapter 3: Who Do You Honor?), and then we introduce our framework (Chapter 7: Lifecycle Phases and Framework). We close by asking people to imagine the future of art education. We then share the ways that we work together currently and the ways that we might get involved in a conversation together with you (Part 5: To Be Continued). Depending on the amount of time that you have as a student or a teacher, we suggest that you skip to the sections that feel most relevant to your context.

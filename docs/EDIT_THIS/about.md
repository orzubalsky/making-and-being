[_Making and Being_](https://store.pioneerworks.org/products/making-and-being) is a multi-platform pedagogical project that offers practices of contemplation, collaboration, and circulation in the visual arts. [_Making and Being_](https://store.pioneerworks.org/products/making-and-being) is a book, a series of videos, a deck of cards, and an interactive website with freely downloadable content created by authors Susan Jahoda and Caroline Woolard with support from [BFAMFAPhD](http://bfamfaphd.com) members Emilio Martinez Poppe, Agnes Szanyi, Emily Tareila, and Vicky Virgin.

We wrote this book for those of you who want a holistic art education that includes how to be both more fully present with yourself and with others. The term holistic means that the parts of any given system are intimately interconnected; that they are understandable only in relation to the whole system. How can you talk about making a new project without talking about labor conditions? How can you talk about labor conditions without talking about payment? Itâ€™s time to address your artistic labor, your budgets your storage units, your gifts, and your well-being.
